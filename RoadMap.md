# Homelab Roadmap

## Phase 1: Setup Proxmox

- [ ] Install Proxmox on a dedicated server
- [ ] Configure network settings and storage
- [ ] Create virtual machines (VMs) for different services

## Phase 2: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

- [ ] Set up a Terraform project
- [ ] Define infrastructure resources (VMs, networks, storage) in Terraform configuration files
- [ ] Provision and manage infrastructure using Terraform commands

## Phase 3: Configuration Management with Ansible

- [ ] Install Ansible on a control machine
- [ ] Define Ansible playbooks for configuring VMs
- [ ] Automate the deployment and configuration of services using Ansible

## Phase 4: Continuous Integration and Deployment

- [ ] Automate the testing and deployment of infrastructure changes
- [ ] Implement version control for infrastructure code

## Phase 5: Monitoring and Logging

- [ ] Configure monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana
- [ ] Set up centralized logging with tools like ELK stack or Graylog
- [ ] Monitor and analyze the performance of your homelab infrastructure

## Phase 6: Security and Backup

- [ ] Implement security best practices for your homelab
- [ ] Set up firewalls and secure remote access
- [ ] Implement regular backups and disaster recovery plans

## Phase 7: Scaling and Optimization

- [ ] Evaluate the performance of your homelab infrastructure
- [ ] Optimize resource allocation and utilization
- [ ] Scale your infrastructure to meet growing demands

## Phase 8: Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

- [ ] Document your homelab setup, configurations, and processes
- [ ] Share your knowledge and experiences with the community
- [ ] Contribute to open-source projects related to homelab setups
